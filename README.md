# React Portfolio.

## Description
This is the secondversion of my portfolio page, updated using react. I created this as a way for future employers to have all the information they would like about me in one spot. I learned more practical applications of css and react.

A form page that valatates the three input feilds as theyare typed. Then there is the portfolio page where 6 pices of my work are displayed with links to the live site and to the github reposatory.
